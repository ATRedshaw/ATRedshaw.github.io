| ------------------ | -------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Luke Humphries     | 25.1                       | -1.0                   |
| Michael van Gerwen | 15.6                       | +3.7                   |
| Luke Littler       | 14.8                       | -0.3                   |
| Josh Rock          | 5.6                        | -0.3                   |
| Stephen Bunting    | 4.2                        | +1.1                   |
| Gary Anderson      | 3.6                        | -0.5                   |
| Wessel Nijman      | 3.5                        | +0.8                   |
| Jonny Clayton      | 3.3                        | -0.6                   |
| Gerwyn Price       | 2.1                        | -0.3                   |

The most significant shift sees Michael van Gerwen's probability of winning surge by +3.7%. His dominant first-round victory and the elimination of Michael Smith have solidified his position as a major favourite in the right half of the draw. Stephen Bunting also sees a notable increase (+1.1%) after his successful navigation of his second-round match, strengthening his prospects in the top left quarter of the draw. Conversely, Luke Humphries experiences the largest decrease (-1.0%), although he remains the overall favourite. This could be attributed to the anticipated victors so far from players in his half of the draw. Luke Littler also sees a slight decrease (-0.3%), reflecting the strengthening competition in this half. It's facinating to watch the shifting dynamics of the tournament playing out in realtime.
