### Day 12 Match Results and Predictions:

**Afternoon Session (12:30 GMT)**

    *   **Result:** Jeffrey de Graaf 4-1 Paolo Nebrida
    *   **Model Prediction:** Correct.

Jeffrey de Graaf booked his place in the next round with a solid victory over Paolo Nebrida. Despite a tight first set going to Nebrida, De Graaf found his rhythm to win the following four sets, including a show-stopping 10-darter to seal the match.

*   **Kevin Doets vs. Krzysztof Ratajski**
    *   **Kevin Doets** Pre-Match Odds: 43.1%
    *   **Krzysztof Ratajski** Pre-Match Odds: 56.9%
    *   **Result:** Kevin Doets 4-3 Krzysztof Ratajski
    *   **Model Prediction:** Incorrect.

In a dramatic encounter, Kevin Doets pulled off a remarkable comeback against Krzysztof Ratajski. Doets found himself trailing early, losing the first six legs of the match. However, showing incredible resilience, he won six of the next seven legs to level the score. He survived four match darts before finally taking the lead for the first time at 2-1 in the deciding set, eventually clinching a memorable victory.

*   **Dimitri van den Bergh vs. Callan Rydz**
    *   **Dimitri van den Bergh** Pre-Match Odds: 39.0%
    *   **Callan Rydz** Pre-Match Odds: 61.0%
    *   **Result:** Dimitri van den Bergh 0-4 Callan Rydz
    *   **Model Prediction:** Correct.

Callan Rydz delivered a stunning performance to whitewash the higher-seeded Dimitri van den Bergh. Rydz was in scintillating form, averaging a superb 105.31, including a blistering 115.94 average across the first two sets. He peppered in six maximums and was clinical on his doubles early on, converting six of his first nine attempts. This victory marks Rydz's return to the World Championship quarter-finals, a feat he last achieved in 2022.

**Evening Session (19:00 GMT)**

*   **Ricky Evans vs. Robert Owen**
    *   **Ricky Evans** Pre-Match Odds: 45.6%
    *   **Robert Owen** Pre-Match Odds: 54.4%
    *   **Result:** Ricky Evans 2-4 Robert Owen
    *   **Model Prediction:** Correct.

Robert Owen secured the biggest win of his career, overcoming Ricky Evans in a compelling contest. After trailing 2-1, Owen dug deep to win the next three sets and advance to the next round. This victory is particularly sweet for Owen, who had previously exited in the first round in his only other World Championship appearance. Throughout the match, Owen revealed he was motivating himself by saying "I'm here" in Welsh, dedicating his performance to his family.

*   **Jonny Clayton vs. Gerwyn Price**
    *   **Jonny Clayton** Pre-Match Odds: 59.6%
    *   **Gerwyn Price** Pre-Match Odds: 40.4%
    *   **Result:** Jonny Clayton 2-4 Gerwyn Price
    *   **Model Prediction:** Incorrect.

Gerwyn Price powered his way into the quarter-finals for the fifth time in the last six years, defeating his good friend and World Cup teammate Jonny Clayton. Price started strongly, averaging 107 in establishing a 2-0 lead. While his average dipped as Clayton fought back to level at 2-2, Price regained his composure to win the final two sets and secure the victory. Price admitted he "couldn't hit a barn door" in the middle stages but was relieved to get the win.

*   **Luke Humphries vs. Peter Wright**
    *   **Luke Humphries** Pre-Match Odds: 80.9%
    *   **Peter Wright** Pre-Match Odds: 19.1%
    *   **Result:** Luke Humphries 1-4 Peter Wright
    *   **Model Prediction:** Incorrect.

In a stunning upset, defending champion Luke Humphries was knocked out of the tournament by a resurgent Peter Wright. Despite Humphries averaging a respectable 99.23 and hitting 56.3% of his doubles, Wright was in exceptional form, averaging 100.93 and boasting an impressive 70% checkout percentage. Wright, despite a difficult year, showed glimpses of his two-time World Champion pedigree. Humphries, while disappointed, can take solace in retaining his world number one ranking due to the two-year Order of Merit. Wright, reflecting on his victory, stated, "I've been struggling for form all year... I'm not too old and you only have to play well for two or three weeks the whole year."
