| --------------------- | -------------------------- |-----------------------|
| Luke Humphries        | 25.3                        | +3.9  |
| Luke Littler          | 15.0                       | -0.7  |
| Michael van Gerwen    | 11.3                       | -0.3  |
| Josh Rock             | 5.3                        | -0.3  |
| Gary Anderson         | 4.1                        | -0.2  |

| Michael Smith         | 1.9                        | -0.1  |

With Humphries the only player from the top 10 favourites to have played, his odds have taken a considerable boost. As expected, others' odds have taken a hit due to the elimination of a slim number of projections where Humphries faced an upset and exited the competition on the opening day.
