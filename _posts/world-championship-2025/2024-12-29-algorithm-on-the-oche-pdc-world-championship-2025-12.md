## Day 12: A recap and model performance

Day 11 at Ally Pally delivered plenty of excitement as the fourth round got underway. We saw some dominant performances, a few tight encounters, and the emergence of clear contenders as the tournament progresses.

### Day 11 Match Results and Predictions:

    *   **Ryan Searle** Pre-Match Odds: 85.3%
    *   **Result:** Ryan Joyce 4-3 Ryan Searle
    *   **Model Prediction:** Incorrect.

Ryan Joyce pulled off a significant upset, defeating the higher-seeded Ryan Searle in a closely contested seven-set thriller. Searle was heavily favoured by the model, but Joyce showed great composure to secure the victory.

*   **Scott Williams vs. Ricardo Pietreczko**
    *   **Scott Williams** Pre-Match Odds: 28.3%
    *   **Ricardo Pietreczko** Pre-Match Odds: 71.7%
    *   **Result:** Scott Williams 1-4 Ricardo Pietreczko
    *   **Model Prediction:** Correct.

Ricardo Pietreczko lived up to the model's prediction, securing a relatively comfortable 4-1 victory over Scott Williams. Pietreczko controlled the match for the most part, limiting Williams' opportunities.

*   **Nathan Aspinall vs. Andrew Gilding**
    *   **Nathan Aspinall** Pre-Match Odds: 53.2%
    *   **Andrew Gilding** Pre-Match Odds: 46.8%
    *   **Result:** Nathan Aspinall 4-0 Andrew Gilding
    *   **Model Prediction:** Correct.

Nathan Aspinall delivered a dominant performance, whitewashing Andrew Gilding in straight sets. Despite the close pre-match odds, Aspinall asserted his dominance early and never allowed Gilding into the match.

**Evening Session (19:00 GMT)**

*   **Chris Dobey vs. Josh Rock**
    *   **Chris Dobey** Pre-Match Odds: 20.9%
    *   **Josh Rock** Pre-Match Odds: 79.1%
    *   **Result:** Chris Dobey 4-2 Josh Rock
    *   **Model Prediction:** Incorrect.

Chris Dobey produced a notable upset, defeating the highly-rated Josh Rock. Rock, considered one of the favourites, led 1-0 and 2-1 but Dobey grew stronger as the match progressed, winning the fourth set 3-0. Rock missed crucial set darts in the fifth, allowing Dobey to capitalise. Dobey finished with a 97.29 average and a 45.2% checkout percentage.

*   **Michael van Gerwen vs. Brendan Dolan**
    *   **Michael van Gerwen** Pre-Match Odds: 95.3%
    *   **Brendan Dolan** Pre-Match Odds: 4.7%
    *   **Result:** Michael van Gerwen 4-2 Brendan Dolan
    *   **Model Prediction:** Correct.

Michael van Gerwen overcame a spirited challenge from Brendan Dolan to secure his place in the next round. Dolan took the opening set, but Van Gerwen responded by winning eight consecutive legs to establish a 3-1 lead, including an impressive 118.66 average in the fourth set. Despite a dip in the fifth set, which Dolan won, Van Gerwen ultimately prevailed.

*   **Luke Littler vs. Ian White**
    *   **Luke Littler** Pre-Match Odds: 80.2%
    *   **Ian White** Pre-Match Odds: 19.8%
    *   **Result:** Luke Littler 4-1 Ian White
    *   **Model Prediction:** Correct.

Luke Littler continued his impressive run, defeating Ian White despite admitting he wasn't at his absolute best. The 17-year-old survived set darts in the first and fourth sets. He displayed his brilliance in the third set, requiring only 39 darts for a clean sweep and averaging 115. His overall average for the match was 97.84.
