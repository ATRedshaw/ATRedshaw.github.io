After thoroughly enjoying the excitement of my simulation work for the 2024 World Matchplay, and following closely on the heels of similar simulations I conducted for the World Grand Prix (a write-up for which is still in the pipeline), I'm thrilled to present my latest projections for the 2025 PDC World Championship. For those who have seen my Matchplay predictions, you'll recall that my model, while not always perfect, had a knack for spotting emerging trends and under-appreciated talent. This was further reinforced by my World Grand Prix projections, which remarkably gave eventual winner Mike De Decker a 1.5% chance of victory at the tournament start, six times the 0.25% odds most bookmakers were offering.

Now, turning our attention to the grandest stage in darts, the World Championship, I've once again employed my hybrid ELO and machine learning-based simulation approach. This intricate process involved extensive web scraping, data collection, and running 1,000,000 tournament simulations to arrive at these insights. With the oche set and the algorithms whirring, let's delve into what the data tells us about this year's contenders and the thrilling matchups awaiting us on Day 1.

## Tournament Preview: The Favourites

Before we get to the nitty-gritty of the opening day, let's take a look at the overall tournament picture. Who are the players my model deems most likely to lift the Sid Waddell Trophy? Here are the top 10 contenders, according to the simulations:

| Player                | Probability of Winning (%) |
| --------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Luke Humphries        | 21.4                       |
| Luke Littler          | 15.7                       |
| Michael van Gerwen    | 11.6                       |
| Josh Rock             | 5.6                        |
| Gary Anderson         | 4.3                        |
| Jonny Clayton         | 4.0                        |
| Mike de Decker        | 3.7                        |
| Stephen Bunting       | 3.1                        |
| Wessel Nijman         | 2.9                        |
| Michael Smith         | 2.0                        |

As we can see, **Luke Humphries** leads the pack with a 21.4% chance of winning the tournament. He's closely followed by **Luke Littler**, the young prodigy, with a 15.7% chance. It's worth noting that Littler's meteoric rise has been one of the stories of the darting world, and the model reflects his potential to go all the way.

**Michael van Gerwen**, a three-time World Champion, is always a threat, and the model gives him an 11.6% chance of adding a fourth title to his collection. **Josh Rock**, a player who's been knocking on the door of a major title, is also a strong contender with a 5.6% chance.

## Day 1: Match Previews

The opening day of the World Championship is always filled with anticipation and excitement. This year, we have three intriguing matches to kick things off:

### Round 1

#### Match 1: Thibault Tricole vs. Joe Comito

*   **Thibault Tricole:**
    *   Match Odds: 86.7%
    *   Tournament Winning Odds: 0.1%
*   **Joe Comito:**
    *   Match Odds: 13.3%
    *   Tournament Winning Odds: 0.0%

This match pits the Frenchman, **Thibault Tricole**, against the American, **Joe Comito**. Tricole is the clear favourite, with the model giving him an 86.7% chance of winning this match. Comito, however, will be looking to cause an upset and has a 13.3% chance of doing so, according to the simulations. Neither player is expected to go deep into the tournament, with Tricole having a 0.1% chance and Comito a 0.0% chance of winning it all.

The winner of this match will face a daunting task in the second round, as they'll be up against the World Number One, **Luke Humphries**.

#### Match 2: Jermaine Wattimena vs. Stefan Bellmont

*   **Jermaine Wattimena:**
    *   Match Odds: 78.6%
    *   Tournament Winning Odds: 0.7%
*   **Stefan Bellmont:**
    *   Match Odds: 21.4%
    *   Tournament Winning Odds: 0.0%

In the second match of the day, Dutchman **Jermaine Wattimena** takes on Switzerland's **Stefan Bellmont**. Wattimena is the favourite, with a 78.6% chance of progressing to the next round. Bellmont, while the underdog, has a 21.4% chance of causing an upset. Wattimena has a 0.7% chance of winning the tournament, while Bellmont's chances are negligible.

The winner of this match will face the experienced **James Wade** in the second round, a player who knows his way around the Ally Pally stage.

#### Match 3: Kim Huybrechts vs. Keane Barry

*   **Kim Huybrechts:**
    *   Match Odds: 59.6%
    *   Tournament Winning Odds: 0.2%
*   **Keane Barry:**
    *   Match Odds: 40.4%
    *   Tournament Winning Odds: 0.2%

The final Round 1 match of the opening day sees Belgium's **Kim Huybrechts** face off against the young Irishman, **Keane Barry**. This is the closest match of the day, with Huybrechts having a 59.6% chance of winning and Barry a 40.4% chance. Both players have a 0.2% chance of winning the entire tournament.

The reward for the winner of this match is a second-round clash with Welshman **Gerwyn Price**, a former World Champion and one of the most formidable players in the game.

### Round 2

#### Match 4: Luke Humphries vs Thibault Tricole/Joe Comito

*   **Luke Humphries:**
    *   Match Odds: 86.6%
    *   Tournament Winning Odds: 21.4%
*   **Thibault Tricole/Joe Comito:**
    *   Match Odds: 13.4%
    *   Tournament Winning Odds: Tricole 0.1%, Comito 0.0%

This second-round match features the formidable **Luke Humphries**, the World Number One, kicking off his title defence against the winner of the first-round clash between **Thibault Tricole** and **Joe Comito**. Humphries is the overwhelming favourite, with my model giving him an 86.6% chance of progressing to the next round. This aligns with his impressive tournament-winning odds of 21.4%, making him the top contender for the title.

Looking at the potential opponents, the simulations heavily favour Tricole over Comito in their initial match. Regardless, the winner will face a monumental challenge against Humphries, with only a 13.4% combined chance of causing a major upset based on the current data.

Humphries' path forward, should he prevail as expected, would likely involve a third-round meeting with **Raymond van Barneveld** should he progress as the favourite in his second round tie against the winner of **Nick Kenny** vs **Stowe Buntz**.  


## Conclusion

The 2025 PDC World Championship promises to be a thrilling spectacle, with a mix of established stars and rising talents all vying for the sport's ultimate prize. The data provides a fascinating glimpse into the potential outcomes, but as we all know, darts is a sport where anything can happen on the day.

Will Luke Humphries live up to his billing as the favourite? Can Luke Littler continue his remarkable rise? Or will we see a surprise winner emerge, as Mike De Decker did in the World Grand Prix? Only time will tell.

One thing is for sure: the action on Day 1 will set the tone for the rest of the tournament. With underdogs looking to make a name for themselves and established players seeking to avoid early exits, the oche will be a cauldron of tension and excitement. I for one cannot wait for the excitement brought on by the biggest darts event of the year.
