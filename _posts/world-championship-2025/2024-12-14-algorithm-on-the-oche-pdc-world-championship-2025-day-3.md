## Updated Tournament Favourites

Following yesterday's results, here are the updated top 10 tournament favourites according to 1,000,000 simulations:

| Player                | Probability of Winning (%) | Change from Day 2 (%) |
| --------------------- | -------------------------- |-----------------------|
| Luke Humphries        | 25.2                        | -0.1  |
| Luke Littler          | 15.6                        | +0.6  |
| Michael van Gerwen    | 11.3                        | 0.0   |
| Josh Rock             | 5.2                         | -0.1  |
| Gary Anderson         | 4.2                         | +0.1  |
| Jonny Clayton         | 3.7                         | -0.2  |
| Mike de Decker        | 3.2                         | -0.2  |
| Stephen Bunting       | 2.8                         | 0.0   |
| Wessel Nijman         | 2.6                         | -0.3  |
| Gerwyn Price          | 2.3                         | +1.1  |

While the top ten still remains largely unchanged, with minor fluctuations in their probabilities, Gerywn Price has forced out Michael Smith following his victory over Keane Barry. It is worth noting, that Price and Humphries remain the only two players in this ten to have played their second round matches. Following his win over James Wade, Jermaine Wattimena has climbed up to 11th favourite at this point in time, shooting from 0.8% of tournament victory up to 2.0%. He seems to be in fine form, and it will be interesting to see how he fares against the winner of Plaisier vs Wright.
