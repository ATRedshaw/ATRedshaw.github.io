## Updated Tournament Favourites

Following yesterday's results, here are the updated top 10 tournament favourites according to 1,000,000 simulations:

| Player                | Probability of Winning (%) | Change from Day 3 (%) |
| --------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Luke Humphries        | 26.3                       | +1.1 |
| Luke Littler          | 15.3                       | -0.3 |
| Michael van Gerwen    | 11.1                       | -0.2 |
| Josh Rock             | 5.4                        | +0.2 |
| Gary Anderson         | 4.0                        | -0.2 |
| Jonny Clayton         | 3.8                        | +0.1 |
| Stephen Bunting       | 3.2                        | +0.4 |
| Wessel Nijman         | 2.6                        | +0.0 |
| Gerwyn Price          | 2.3                        | +0.0 |
| Jermaine Wattimena    | 2.3                        | +0.3 |

The major talking point from the updated table is the removal of Mike de Decker from the top 10 after his shock defeat to Luke Woodhouse, marking the first major upset of the tournament. This has opened up the quarter for Luke Humphries, explaining his increased likelihood to retain his title. Meanwhile, Luke Woodhouse has seen a significant jump in his chances, climbing to 17th place with a 0.7% chance of winning the tournament, highlighting the impact of his unforseen victory.
