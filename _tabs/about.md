## Academic Experience

#### University

**BSC Computer Science (Digital & Technology Solutions) - 2:1** 

**Digital & Technology Solutions Professional (Data Analyst Pathway) - Level 6 Apprenticeship** 

During my studies, I developed a strong foundation in data visualisation, data analysis, machine learning, and cloud computing. I further enhanced my skills by completing a Masters Level module in Data Science, achieving a 1st class grade.

My passion for sports analytics led me to write my dissertation on ["Machine Learning Models for Probabilistic Football Analysis and Prediction,"](https://github.com/ATRedshaw/ATRedshaw.github.io/blob/main/assets/pdf/dissertation/Redshaw-Alex-Dissertation-2024.pdf) which also received a 1st class grade. This project allowed me to apply my data science and machine learning knowledge to a real-world challenge, developing predictive models to analyse and forecast football outcomes, as well as developing my own custom expected goals (xG) model.

## Professional Experience

Over the past 4 years, I have gained valuable professional experience at one of the Big 4 professional services firms, working in a range of areas in the Data & Analytics practice.

Across this time, I have honed my skills in data visualisation (Tableau), database management (SQL), as well as interpesonal presentation and communication skills. This has been achieved through various projects, including development of interactive client dashboards, implementation of complex SQL rule logic, and effective communication of technical data-insights to diverse audiences. More recently, I have focused on automating internal tracking processes using Python. I developed and deployed data management solutions that streamlined workflows and significantly reduced manual effort, saving the company valuable time and resources.

## Personal Interests

Outside of work, I am a big sports fan. I enjoy playing Football (and most other sports in general), as well as supporting Liverpool FC and taking a keen interest in Formula 1 and Darts. I also have a mild obsession with Fantasy Premier League. In the 2022/23 season, I pursued a data-informed approach to optimising FPL team selection, achieving an overall rank of 1,326 out of over 10 million players. Additionally, in this season, I won 20 consecutive head-to-head ties to win the Liverpool cup competition. I have unfortunately accepted that my FPL career is only going downhill from that season.

I also enjoy applying my data analysis skills to personal sports analytics projects. I've developed statistical models and analyses in all of the afformentioned sporting endeavours, exploring different data science and machine learning techniques. You can find a selection of preliminary write-ups for these on this site, with plenty more in the pipeleine (when the time allows!).
