## Introduction

Hi, I'm Alex, a highly motivated and results-oriented Data Analyst with a passion for turning data into actionable insights. I enjoy tackling complex problems and developing creative solutions using a combination of technical skills and analytical thinking. My background in computer science and data science, combined with my enthusiasm for sports analytics, allows me to approach challenges from a unique perspective.

## Skills

I possess a diverse range of skills essential for effective data analysis and problem-solving:

* **Data Visualisation:**  Creating clear and impactful visuals to communicate data insights.
    * Tableau:  Building interactive dashboards and reports to explore and present data.
    * Python (Matplotlib):  Generating custom visualisations and plots for detailed analysis.
    * Information Visualisation Principles: Applying best practices to design effective and engaging visualisations and dashboards.

* **Data Analysis & Manipulation:**  Extracting, cleaning, and transforming data to uncover meaningful patterns.
    * Python (Pandas, NumPy):  Performing data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis.
    * Alteryx:  Automating data preparation and blending workflows.
    * Statistical Analysis: Applying statistical methods to analyse data and draw conclusions.

* **Machine Learning:**  Building predictive models and algorithms to extract insights and make predictions.
    * Python (Scikit-learn): Implementing various machine learning algorithms for classification, regression, and clustering tasks.
    * Model Evaluation & Selection: Assessing model performance and choosing the best model for a given problem.

* **Database Management:**  Working with relational databases to store, retrieve, and manage data.
    * SQL:  Querying and manipulating data in relational database systems.
    * MS SQL Server: Experience with Microsoft SQL Server database management system.
    * Azure Dynamo DB & Azure SQL DB: Familiarity with cloud-based database services.

* **Cloud Computing:**  Utilising cloud platforms for data storage, processing, and analysis.
    * Azure:  Experience with Microsoft Azure cloud services, including Functions and SQL Database.
    * GCP:  Familiarity with Google Cloud Platform, including Cloud Functions and Cloud Deploy.
    * AWS:  Basic knowledge of Amazon Web Services, including Lambda functions.

* **Statistical Modeling:**  Building mathematical models to represent and analyse real-world phenomena.
    * Python (PuLP): Implementing optimisation models for decision-making.
    * Monte-Carlo Simulation:  Performing simulations to analyse risk and uncertainty.

## Academic Experience

I graduated from the University of Leeds with a 2:1 BSc in Computer Science (Digital & Technology Solutions). During my studies, I developed a strong foundation in data visualisation, data analysis, machine learning, and cloud computing. I further enhanced my skills by completing a Masters Level module in Data Science, achieving a 1st class grade.

My passion for sports analytics led me to write my dissertation on "Machine Learning Models for Probabilistic Football Analysis and Prediction," which also received a 1st class grade. This project allowed me to apply my data science and machine learning knowledge to a real-world challenge, developing predictive models to analyse and forecast football outcomes, as well as developing my own custom expected goals (xG) model.

## Professional Experience

Over the past 4 years, I have gained valuable professional experience at one of the Big 4 professional services firms, working in a range of areas in the Data & Analytics practice.

Across this time, I have honed my skills in data visualisation (Tableau), database management (SQL), as well as interpesonal presentation and communication skills. This has been achieved through various projects, including development of interactive client dashboards, implementation of complex SQL rule logic, and effective communication of technical data-insights to diverse audiences. More recently, I have focused on automating internal tracking processes using Python. I developed and deployed data management solutions that streamlined workflows and significantly reduced manual effort, saving the company valuable time and resources.

## Personal Interests

Outside of work, I am a big sports fan. I enjoy playing Football and Padel, as well as supporting Liverpool FC and taking a keen interest in Formula 1 and Darts. I also have a mild obsession with Fantasy Premier League. In the 2022/23 season, I pursued a data-informed approach to optimising FPL team selection, achieving an overall rank of 1,326 out of over 10 million players. Additionally, in this season, I won 20 consecutive head-to-head ties to win the Liverpool cup competition. I have unfortunately accepted that my FPL career is only going downhill from that season.

I also enjoy applying my data analysis skills to personal sports analytics projects. I've developed statistical models and analyses in all of the afformentioned sporting endeavours, exploring different data science and machine learning techniques. You can find a selection of preliminary write-ups for these on this site, with plenty more in the pipeleine (when the time allows!).
